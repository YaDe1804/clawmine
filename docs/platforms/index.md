# Platforms

OpenClaw core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway (WhatsApp/Telegram bugs).

A companion app exists for Android. Windows and Linux companion apps are
planned, but the Gateway is fully supported today.

## Common links

- Install guide: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- Gateway runbook: [Gateway](/gateway)
- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)
- Service status: `openclaw gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `openclaw gateway install`
- Configure flow: `openclaw configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `openclaw doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:

- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service (`openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
- Native Windows: Scheduled Task (`OpenClaw Gateway` or `OpenClaw Gateway (<profile>)`), with a per-user Startup-folder login item fallback if task creation is denied
